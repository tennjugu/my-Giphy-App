# Giphy Search App

Welcome to my Giphy Search App! This simple web application allows you to search for and display GIFs from [Giphy](https://giphy.com). It was built as part of an exercise in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to learn how to obtain information from an API using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
